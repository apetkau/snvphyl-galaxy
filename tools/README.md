SNVPhyl Tools
=============

This directory contains the necessary dependency tools for SNVPhyl.  These must be uploaded to a [Galaxy Toolshed][] to be used to install in different Galaxy instances.  Installing these tools to a separate toolshed can be accomplished by the following steps.

1.  Upload all tool capsules in [capsules][].  These were exported from the [Main Galaxy Toolshed][].

2.  Upload all custom tools for SNVPhyl.  This can be accomplished using [Planemo][] by running:

    ```
    ./scripts/run_planemo_for_tools.sh shed_create --shed_target http://localhost:9010 --shed_key 30c7ca4b73669666178b2aee378a2b99 -m 'commit'
    ```

    Where `run_planemo_for_tools.sh` runs the passed parameters using planemo on all tools defined in [tools-to-install][].

3.  To, later, update, please run:

    ```
    ./scripts/run_planemo_for_tools.sh shed_update --shed_target http://localhost:9010 --shed_key 30c7ca4b73669666178b2aee378a2b99 -m 'commit'
    ```
