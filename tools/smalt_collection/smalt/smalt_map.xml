**What it does**

SMALT is a pairwise sequence alignment program for the experimentingcient mapping of DNA sequencing reads onto genomic reference sequences. It uses a combination of short-word hashing and dynamic programming. Most types of sequencing platforms are supported including paired-end sequencing reads.


------


**Know what you are doing**

.. class:: warningmark

There is no such thing (yet) as an automated gearshift in short read mapping. It is all like stick-shift driving in San Francisco. In other words = running this tool with default parameters will probably not give you meaningful results. A way to deal with this is to **understand** the parameters by carefully reading the `documentation`__ and experimenting. Fortunately, Galaxy makes experimenting easy.

**Input formats**

SMALT accepts files in Sanger FASTQ format (galaxy type *fastqsanger*). Use the FASTQ Groomer to prepare your files.

  -a
     Output explicit alignments along with the mappings.

  -c &#060;mincover&#062;
     Only consider mappings where the k-mer word seeds cover the query read to
     a minimum extent. If &#060;mincover&#062; is an integer or floating point &#062; 1.0, at
     least this many bases of the read must be covered by k-mer word seeds. If
     &#060;mincover&#062; is a floating point &#060;= 1.0, it specifies the fraction of the
     query read length that must be covered by k-mer word seeds. This option
     is only valid in conjunction with the '-x' flag.

  -d &#060;scordiff&#062;
     Set a threshold of the Smith-Waterman alignment score relative to the
     maximum score. All mappings are reported that have Smith-Waterman scores
     within &#060;scorediff&#062; of the maximum score. Mappings with scores lower than
     this value are skipped. This option has no effect when paired reads are
     mapped.
     &#060;scorediff&#062; is an integer. If set to 0 (default) only mappings with the
     best score are reported. Reads with multiple best mappings are reported
     as unmapped. If set to a value &#060; 0, report all alignments with scores
     above the threshold specified with the '-m &#060;minscor&#062;' option.

  -f &#060;format&#062;
     Specifies the output format. &#060;format&#062; can be either 'cigar' (default),
     'sam' (samtools.sourceforge.net, hard clipped), 'samsoft' (sam output
     using soft clipping) or 'ssaha' (ssaha2 default output format).

  -g &#060;insfil&#062;
     Use the distribution of insert sizes stored in the file &#060;insfil&#062;. This
     file is in ASCII format and can be generated using the 'sample' task see
     'smalt sample -H' for help).

  -H
     Print these instructions.

  -i &#060;insertmax&#062;
     Maximum insert size (only in paired-end mode). The default is 500.

  -j &#060;insertmin&#062;
     Minimum insert size (only in paired-end mode). The default is 0.

  -l &#060;pairtyp&#062;
     Type of read pair library. &#060;pairtyp&#062; can be either 'pe', i.e. for
     the Illumina paired-end library for short inserts. 'mp' for the Illumina mate-pair library for long inserts  or
     'pp' for mates sequenced on the same strand


  -m &#060;minscor&#062;
     Sets an absolute threshold of the Smith-Waterman scores. Mappings with
     scores below that threshold will not be reported. The default is
     &#060;minscor&#062; = &#060;wordlen&#062; + &#060;stepsiz&#062; - 1

  -n &#060;nthreads&#062;
     Run smalt using mutiple threads. &#060;nthread&#062; is the number of additional
     threads forked from the main thread. The order of the reads in the
     input files is not preserved for the output unless '-O' is also specified.

  -o &#060;oufilnam&#062;
     Write mapping output (e.g. SAM lines) to a separate file. If this option
     is not specified, mappings are written to standard output together with
     other messages.

  -O
     Output mappings in the order of the reads in the input files when using
     multiple threads (option '-n &#060;nthreads&#062;').

  -p
     Report partial alignments if they are complementary on the read (split
     reads).

  -q &#060;minbasq&#062;
     Sets a base quality threshold (0 &#060;= minbasq &#060;= 10, default 0).
     K-mer words of the read with nucleotides that have a base quality below
     this threshold are not looked up in the hash index.

  -r &#060;seed&#062;
     If the there are multiple mappings with the same best alignment score
     report one picked at random. This is relevant only in paired-end mode or
     with the option -d 0 (the default).
     &#060;seed&#062; is an integer &#062;= 0 used to seed the pseudo-random genarator. With
     &#060;seed&#062; = 0 a seed is derived from the current calendar time. Without this
     option (the default) reads with multiple best mappings are reported as
     unmapped.

  -w
     Smith-Waterman scores are complexity weighted.

  -x
     This flag triggers a more exhaustive search for alignments at the cost
     of decreased speed. In paired-end mode each mate is mapped independently.
     (By default the mate with fewer hits in the hash index is mapped first
     and the vicinity is searched for mappings of its mate.)

  -y &#060;minid&#062;
     Sets an identity threshold for a mapping to be reported (default: 0).
     &#060;minid&#062; specifies the number of exactly matching nucleotides either as
     a positive integer or as a fraction of the read length (&#060;= 1.0).
